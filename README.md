# Soccer-Arena
Interactive virtual reality soccer arena. Developed in Unity3D for Android.

Instructions:

The player initially spawns with a dynamic world space crosshair, which renders over the surface of any object. 
On one side of the wall, you'll see the "Crosshair Controls" label where players can choose between a dynamic 
or static crosshair. In dynamic mode, the crosshair will render over all surfaces and there is an option that 
makes the crosshair a fixed size. In static mode, the crosshair is fixed at 5 meters away from the player by default. 
In this mode, you can move the crosshair in and out of surfaces as well as increase or decrease the 
crosshair-to-player distance with the respective up and down arrows on the wall. On the opposite side, 
there is a light switch that you can use to turn on and off the lights. On the backside of the wall, 
there is a screen used to toggle some jazz music. Lastly, the half sphere protruding out of the ground 
is used to toggle the scale of the "Earth" located on the field. Forward and backward movement is triggered 
by swiping the screen up or down when in landscape mode.
